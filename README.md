# herokuMLapp_riskClassification
A multi-variate, binary classification model showcasing the capabilities of streamlit in rapid proto-typing data science tasks.  


If you want to try by yourself, download the files of this repo to run the 'interactiveRegression' Streamlit app.
Otherwise, you can check out the app hosted at Heroku :  https://mlapp-classification-riskclass.herokuapp.com/


To run the app from your machine, follow the steps:

Step 1 : Open  a terminal

Step 2 : Clone this repo in your  machine.

Step 3 : If you do not have streamlit installed, install streamlit using 'pip3  install streamlit'.  Then follow Step 2.

Step 4 : If you already have streamlit installed, go to the folder which contains the cloned files.

Step 5 : At the command prompt type : streamlit run main.py, where 'main.py' is the python script that fires the app. 


The steps above are the quickest and simplest to run the app. 

The best way to run the app is to create a python environment and do everything within this environment.
